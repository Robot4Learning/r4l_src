The Robots for Learning (R4L) research interest group is an international and inter-disciplinary groups of researcher interested in investigating the use of social robots in education.

An increasing amount of HRI research focuses on the development of social robots acting as tutors. These studies have shown that the potential of robots in educational settings is inarguable: robot can provide educational content tailored to the individual, enhance learning via kinesthetic interaction, improve the learnerâ€™s self-esteem and can provide empathic feedback.
However, many questions still remain. For instance, what interaction strategies aid learning, and which hamper learning? How can we deal with the current technical limitations of robots? How should effective lessons be developed and implemented on a robot? Answering these and other questions requires a multidisciplinary effort, including contributions from pedagogy, developmental psychology, (computational) linguistics, artificial intelligence and HRI, among others.
The aim of this group is to engage scholars who aim to gain expertise in education and in robotics (from instructional design to inverse kinematics, ROS to ZPD, Markov to Piaget) into a new  interdisciplinary community working on educational robotics. 

This platform is used to share latest research works from the forefront of field and from discussions on how to move from fundamental research towards the development of market-ready educational robots.
